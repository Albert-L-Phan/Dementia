## What is Dementia?

Dementia is a syndrome that leads to the impairment of cognitive function and affects memory and speech. It currently affects more than 400,000 Australians. Dementia is one of the leading causes of death in Australia and can have significant socioeconomic and psychological impacts on both the quality of life of people with dementia, as well as care providers. There are certain factors that may increase the risk for dementia. These include age, socioeconomic factors, obesity, smoking and exercise. 

This study explores the impacts of these factors on the incidence of Dementia at the Local Government Area (LGA) level. These are administrative regions in Australia that are governed by local councils. We collected data at the LGA for factors such as health measurements (smoking, obesity, high blood pressure), along with socioeconomic factors from PHIDU.
