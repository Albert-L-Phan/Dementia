# Dementia


## What is Dementia?

Dementia is a syndrome that leads to the impairment of cognitive function and affects memory and speech. It currently affects more than 400,000 Australians. Dementia is one of the leading causes of death in Australia and can have significant socioeconomic and psychological impacts on both the quality of life of people with dementia, as well as care providers. There are certain factors that may increase the risk for dementia. These include age, socioeconomic factors, obesity, smoking and exercise. 

This study explores the impacts of these factors on the incidence of Dementia at the Local Government Area (LGA) level. These are administrative regions in Australia that are governed by local councils. We collected data at the LGA for factors such as health measurements (smoking, obesity, high blood pressure), along with socioeconomic factors from PHIDU. 


## Exercise

One of the risk factors for dementia is exercise. As people living in some regions can access more ways to exercise compared to others, we need to find ways to measure access to exercise. 

One way of measuring access to exercise is to find the distance between bike paths and households. First, we can find all the meshblocks in Australia, which are small geographic areas that are classified into certain groups, such as residential, industrial or commercial. We filter out only those that are categorised as 'residential' and calculate the shortest distance between each residential meshblock and the closest bike path. From there, we can group the meshblocks according to which LGA they are in, and average the distance in each LGA to find the average distance between bike paths and households at the LGA level.

Another way is to measure the relative access to parks.
